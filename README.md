# Mob Gems
Mob Gems is a **Fabric** mod for Minecraft **1.16.5** based around capturing mobs in diamonds to harness their powers!

- With the Capture enchantment you can trap mobs in mob gems
- Bracelets allows you to gain abillities (good or bad) based on mob gems
- Gem Cages utilize mob gems to create area effects

**Important:** This mod requires **Curios API** for Fabric: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios-fabric

## Capturing mobs
Trapping the souls of mobs in mob gems requires you to enchant a weapon with Capture. It is a rare enchantment that can't be found in the enchantment table, 
but it can be acquired through all other usual methods (villagers, loot). In addition, it also has a very high likelihood of appearing in **stronghold libraries**.
There are three levels available, each level with a higher chance of capturing a mob when killed with the enchanted weapon. To obtain a mob gem, 
make sure to have a **diamond in your off-hand**, which will be turned into a mob gem if you manage to capture a mob's soul.

**Note:** Capture can not be combined with Mending or Looting.

## Using mobs gems

### Bracelets
Bracelets grant the wearer certain effects or abillities that represent a mob's characteristics. These can be either good or bad depending on the mob and the type of bracelet.
Bracelets can be worn on the chest, in your main or off-hand or in the Curios Bracelet slot. Only one bracelet can be active at a time.

- **Golden Bracelets** augment a mob's characteristic, granting the wearer an effect that mimics a mob's behaviour, abilities, etc...
- **Iron Bracelets** diminish a mob's characteristic, granting the wearer an opposite effect of a mob's characteristic

### Gem Cage
Gem Cages are magical blocks that utilize a mob's soul for useful effects on the area or adjacent blocks. Gem cages require a mob gem to function, 
but also a new resource for power: **soul powder**. Crafted from blaze powder and soul sand/soil this magical fuel will power the gem cage and allow it to extract 
effects from the trapped soul of a mob.

## Mob Gem effects
I recommend figuring out all the different effects on your own, prt of the fun is in finding out! However some can be hard to deduce or 
maybe you like knowing what you're getting yourself into. No worries, all effects have been listed below.

**Note:** Only the Zombie, Cow and Iron Golem Mob Gems have been implemented as of yet.
